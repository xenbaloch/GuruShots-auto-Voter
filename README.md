1. You will need install node 8+ [From Here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (All default settings)
2. Create folder "AutoVoter" where you want. In my case path - *C:\GuruShots*
3. After install node 8+ (for windnows) run cmd (on keyboard press windowsBtn+r and type "cmd")
4. Go to your folder by typing:

 `cd C:\GuruShots`

5. Install puppeteer. Type 

 `npm install --save puppeteer`

 Do not close cmd

6. Download *voter_updated.js* and  *LoginData.js* form this page and put them in that folder
7. Open *LoginData.js* with any editor (i use notepad++) and type your login data and save
8. Run script. Type in cmd (note that you need to stay in cmd in your folder)
